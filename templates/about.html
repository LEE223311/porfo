                  <h3>My Journey</h3>
                  <p>As-salamu alaykum, I'm Ali Saleh Ali Al Siyabi! My journey into learning and discovery began with my grandfather, who instilled in me the value of reading, research, and humility in both learning and interacting with others. He taught me to face life's challenges with curiosity and an open mind. This foundation helped shape my approach to everything I do.

                    I was also inspired by great minds such as Carl Sagan and Albert Einstein, whose work in physics sparked my curiosity. Over time, I was introduced to the brilliance of figures like Muhammad Metwalli al-Sha'rawi, John Carmack, Khaled ibn Alwaleed, M.C. Escher, and Geoffrey Hinton, whose ideas broadened my perspective and deepened my passion for learning..</p>
                  <h3>life</h3>
                  <p>I began learning to program out of a desire to overcome feelings of being "stupid" and useless. Programming became my tool for empowerment, giving me the ability to shape my future. I’m also deeply inspired by the Quranic verse "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ 'Are those who know equal to those who do not know?'" (Surah 39:9), which fuels my commitment to lifelong learning and self-improvement.

                    My father taught me the importance of humility, and I strive to embody this in my work and interactions. This humility allows me to approach every challenge with an open mind and a willingness to learn, knowing that there’s always more to discover.
                  <h3>One of my goals in life</h3>
                  <p>
                    With a background in education, I understand how the mind works and how learning processes can be optimized. This knowledge shapes the way I approach problem-solving and development. My primary focus is to create solutions that benefit people on a deeper level, positively impacting lives and helping others grow.

                    Whether it's technology, AI, or education, I’m driven to use what I’ve learned to make a meaningful contribution to society. My goal is to continue developing projects that inspire, challenge, and enhance lives.</p>
